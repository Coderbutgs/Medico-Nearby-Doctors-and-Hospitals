# Medico
Hey buddy... I hope you are doing fine.
The repository you have opened is an ongoing project initialized by me.
The home page is almost complete all we need to do is develop the login and signup page.
Also we need to expand our database.
Oh Yeah one more thing we also need to design an algorithm to search doctors and hospitals based on the symptoms and disease.
So you see there's a lot of work to do. Though if you want to submit this for your clg project its more than enough :)

If you want to contribute to Medico follow my steps -
  1.Fork this repository on your github and download the code.
  2.open the repository on your device and make a branch.
  3.Contribute to the project and send push request.
  4.If it is good i will accept the request.
  5.Thank you in advance for your contribution.

Oh yeah i forgot one thing... if you want to run the project on your device... navigate to frontend folder in your terminal and tyoe "npm run both"
It will do the work.
